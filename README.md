# Huck's Helpful Guides and Resources
this repository was create in June 2023. June 2023 saw many users of the Internet growing worried about the state of social media.
- Twitter is becoming an increasingly unstable platform
- Tumblr is resorting to increasingly unpleasant measures to pay for itself
- large swaths of Reddit are rendered indefinitely unusable due to [site-wide protest](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/06/26/why-reddit-users-are-protesting-against-the-sites-leadership)
- Discord's business model and recent decisions causing people question its long-term sustainability
- Facebook [is looking to expand to the Fediverse](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36384784), making some worry about an ["Embrace, extend, extinguish"](https://ploum.net/2023-06-23-how-to-kill-decentralised-networks.html) tactic

all of this combined is alarming for many people due to a decline in long-term public resources (like independent forums) and an increasing reliance on these platforms for information. many people do not want to join a Discord server to access critical documentation or skills.

while GitHub is not a perfect long-term solution, i figure it would be useful to put guides and resources on a platform where you can download all the files for yourself for use offline. also GitHub has a built-in Markdown renderer for any .MD files like this one
